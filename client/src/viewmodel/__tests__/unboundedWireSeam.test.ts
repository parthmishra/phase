/**
 * ∞-channel cross-seam pin. Both JSON files are ENGINE-EMITTED by
 * `combo_infinite_pile::real_4p_object_growth_accept_writes_infinite_pile` and
 * `kilo_live_offer_from_real_dump::kilo_accept_marks_pentad_charge_as_unbounded_display_target`,
 * each driving a REAL 4-player dump through the REAL APNAP accept. Regenerate with
 * `UPDATE_WIRE_GOLDEN=1 cargo test -p phase-engine --test integration <fn>`. Never hand-edit them.
 * Every existing client test that touches these channels hand-writes its own `derived` block, so
 * this file is the only place the engine's wire shape and the client's readers meet.
 * Both goldens are captured AFTER the accept, while a finite collapse is merely SCHEDULED — the
 * engine defers APPLYING the growth to the next CR 500.5 boundary (an engine deviation,
 * pre-existing and deliberate), and the marks stay live through that window, so the ∞ channels are
 * still populated. If the engine went back to hiding them there, both goldens would regenerate
 * empty and every assertion below would red.
 * The `unbounded_pile → Set` hop is performed here rather than by `gameStateView.ts`, because
 * driving that function would require committing a whole `GameState`; the ids, the field name and
 * the value encoding — the parts that actually differ across the language boundary — are
 * engine-authored.
